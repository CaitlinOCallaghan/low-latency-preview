## Low Latency DASH streaming demo

This is a proof of concept of generating a low latency live stream from encoder, to server, to player using entirely open source software. It will later form the basis of an upload to the larger streamline project. https://github.com/streamlinevideo/streamline

Things to know. 

- This demo assumes that you are using Ubuntu / Debian
- This demo provides everything you need to ruin a low latency live stream for educational purpouses.
- This is a preview and proof of concept. It is not meant to be used in production. There has not been extensive testing yet. There are bugs. I promise you, there are bugs ;). 

TODO for preview project

- OSX directions and scripts
- Maybe Windows directions and scripts
- Polish server performance and reliability
